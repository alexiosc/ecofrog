## Proteus EcoFrog Integration for Home Assistant

[![hacs_badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/HACS-Custom-41BDF5.svg?style=for-the-badge)](https://github.com/hacs/integration)

This custom integration adds support for the _Proteus EcoFrog WLAN_ WiFi
tank level sensor by Proteus. (or is that E-Sensorix?)

You get access to the information provided by the E-sensorix API:

* Current volume of fluid in the tank
* Maximum volume of fluid in the tank
* Percentage of fluid
* Sensor temperature
* Battery (in volts)

## Installation

Since this is a custom component, you must copy the contents of the
`custom_components` folder/directory to your Home Assistant `config`
folder/directory, so it looks like this:

```
config/
└ custom_components/
  └ ecofrog/ 
    ├ __init__.py
    └ ...
```

The exact method to do this depends on whether you're using a VM
image, HA appliance or Docker.

Once you've done this, restart Home Assistant, and the integration
should be visible. Go to Settings → Devices & Services, click the ADD
INTEGRATION button, then search for EcoFrog.

## Configuration

You need four pieces of information to authenticate with the
Proteus/E-Sensorix API:

* a numeric user ID called a ‘username’,
* the E-Mail address you bought or registered the EcoFrog with,
* a ‘Security Stamp’, which is a UUID like `xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx`, and
* the Device ID, a numeric ID of the device to monitor.

To get this information and ensure the API is enabled for your
account, please email info@e-sensorix.com.

Once you've added the device, it should appear in the Integrations,
and show one device for each of your EcoFrogs, and several
sensors. These can be added to your dashboards or used in automations
as always.

## Multiple EcoFrogs

If you have more than one EcoFrog, you need to add the integration
once for each sensor, using the appropriate authentication
information.

## Polling Frequency

In order to be nice to the API servers, polling is limited to once
every hour. A fresh copy of the data is fetched when Home Assistant
restarts.

The EcoFrog samples the tank a few times a day, but _seemingly_ only
uploads fresh data once per 24 hour period. So hourly polls should be
fine.

## Known Issues

The sensor reports absolute volume available in the tank, and also a
‘percent full’ measurement which is reported natively as a percent value.
There is now way in Home Assistant to mark a sensor as reporting volume
as a percentage (and that is technically correct behaviour). It is,
however, very convenient to have this percentage sensor available, so the
integration exposes it. This will cause Home Assistant to issue warnings
about bad units, but those are harmless. If HA provides something a
more appropriate sensor class for percentage reporting, the integration will
be updated to use it instead.

## Issues? Questions?

This is alpha software of the worst possible type.

I hope it works for you, and please let me know if it doesn't! I'd
especially like to know if it works correctly for multiple EcoFrogs,
as I only have one.
